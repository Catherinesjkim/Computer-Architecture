1. Why should we have more than decimal numbers?
Write larger number with fewer characters: hexa decimal

2. How many number bases do we commonly use in computer program? 
Hexa decimal, octal decimal, etc. Base 64 bits --> Addressing

3. Why do we us binary? Because it works well with boolean logic for more complex boolean statements. We use base 2 for computers. On/Off. Every letter, number is stored in binary. Someone is trying to build a base 3 computer but it's not easy.
